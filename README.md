# README

### Purpose :
The following will describe in detail how I formatted and hosted my resume on GitHub Pages using Markdown, a Markdown editor known as Atom, and a static site generator called Jekyll. In addition, I will relate each step of the process to Andrew Etter’s book *Modern Technical Writing*, which discusses the general principles of current Technical Writing.  

### Prerequisites :
1. Basic knowledge of Markdown. Refer to More Resources for a link to a Markdown tutorial.
2. A GitHub account. Refer to More Resources for a link from GitHub on how to get started.
3. A resume formatted in Markdown.
4. Some coffee or tea for moments where you have no idea what you're doing.
