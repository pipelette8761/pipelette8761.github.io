# README

### Purpose :
The following will describe in detail how I formatted and hosted my resume on GitHub Pages using Markdown, a Markdown editor known as Atom, and a static site generator called Jekyll. In addition, I will relate each step of the process to Andrew Etter’s book *Modern Technical Writing*, which discusses the general principles of current Technical Writing.  

### Prerequisites :
1. Basic knowledge of Markdown. Refer to More Resources in this doc for a link to a Markdown tutorial.
2. A GitHub account. Refer to More Resources in this doc for a link from GitHub on how to get started.
3. A resume formatted in Markdown.
4. Some coffee or tea for moments where you have no idea what you're doing.

### Instructions :
#### Creating a GitHub account
*skip this step if you already have one*  
  
1. Under More Resources in this doc, click the link for Getting started with GitHub.
2. Do the steps outlined in *Part 1: Configuring your GitHub account* on the page that opened.

#### Setting up Git and connecting over SSH
*skip this step if you don't plan to work with files locally*

1. Head over to https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git.
2. Under *Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git -> Connecting over SSH*, click generate SSH keys.(https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
3. Choose your operating system (Mac, Windows or Linux) on the page that opened.
4. Follow and complete each step. For step 7 of *Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key*, click *Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account*.(https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
5. Choose your operating system (Mac, Windows or Linux) on the page that opened.
6. Choose Web browser instead of GitHub CLI if the latter's showing.
7. Follow and complete each step.

Congrats ! If you got this far, you now have Git set up locally and will be able to use Git on the command line.

#### Creating a GitHub Pages site

1. Head over to https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site.
2. Follow and complete each step but ignore the *Next steps* section.
3. I opted to use the default site theme, but you can select another one here :  
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser.

#### Hosting a resume

1. Head over to your newly created GitHub Pages repo within your GitHub account. Its name has the format username.github.io.
2. There will be a README.md file along with a folder named docs. Open this docs folder.
3. Open the \_posts folder.
4. Depending on your preference, follow and complete each step for either *Adding a file to a repository on GitHub* or *Adding a file to a repository using the command line* at this link :  
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository.
5.
